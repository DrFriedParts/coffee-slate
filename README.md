coffee-slate
============

Coffeescript builder for [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) configuration files.

Slate is a window management application (replacement for [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/), [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/), or [ShiftIt](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt)). It supports configuration using a native declarative model and a javascript-based functional one.

Now, you can use coffeescript to write the Slate configuration file and compile and install it to Slate in one step.

## Documentation

You can find the javascript API for Slate [here](https://github.com/jigish/slate/wiki/JavaScript-Configs)

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository anywhere you'd like. 
2. Edit the slate.coffee file to suit your tastes
3. Execute install.sh to compile the script and install it in the user home directory (where Slate can find it).
